## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

***CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing)*** allows a webpage to request additional resources into browser from other domains e.g. fonts, CSS or static images from CDN. CORS helps in serving web content from multiple domains into browsers who usually have the same-origin security policy.

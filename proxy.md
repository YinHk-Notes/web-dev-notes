### What is a port number?

A port number is a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a [server](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/server). All network-connected devices come equipped with standardized ports that have an assigned number. These numbers are reserved for certain [protocols](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/protocol) and their associated function. Hypertext Transfer Protocol ([HTTP](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/HTTP-Hypertext-Transfer-Protocol)) messages, for example, always go to [port 80](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/port-80) -- one of the most commonly used ports.

Developers of the [Advanced Research Projects Agency Network](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/ARPANET), an informal cooperation of system administrators and software authors, proposed the concept of port numbers. Once known as *[socket numbers](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/answer/What-is-the-difference-between-a-port-and-a-socket),* the early incarnation of port numbers is similar to the Internet Protocol ([IP](https://www.techtarget.com/searchunifiedcommunications/definition/Internet-Protocol)) address class used today.

A port number is the logical address of each application or process that uses a network or the Internet to communicate. A port number uniquely identifies a network-based application on a computer. Each application/program is allocated a 16-bit integer port number. This number is assigned automatically by the OS, manually by the user or is set as a default for some popular applications.

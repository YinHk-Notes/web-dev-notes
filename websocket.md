## Websocket

> The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a **two-way interactive communicatio**n session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

> A WebSocket is a **persistent connection** between a client and server.

> WebSocket is a computer communications protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

> WebSocket is especially great for services that require continuous data exchange, e.g. online games, real-time trading systems and so on.

## API (Application Programming Interface)

> API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other

> an API is a way for computer programs to talk to each other. Frontend connect to backend server


> APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.

- SOAP APIs 
  These APIs use **Simple Object Access Protoco**l. Client and server exchange messages using **XML**. This is a less flexible API that was more popular in the past.
  
- RPC APIs
  These APIs are called Remote Procedure Calls. The client completes a function (or procedure) on the server, and the server sends the output back to the client.
  
- Websocket APIs
  Websocket API is another modern web API development that uses JSON objects to pass data. A WebSocket API supports two-way communication between client apps and the server. The server can send callback messages to connected clients, making it more efficient than REST API.
  
- REST APIs
  These are the most popular and flexible APIs found on the web today. The client sends requests to the server as data. The server uses this client input to start internal functions and returns output data back to the client.

## cache & cookies
### HTTP caching

> The HTTP cache stores a response associated with a request and reuses the stored response for subsequent requests.
  
> The performance of web sites and applications can be significantly improved by reusing previously fetched resources. Web caches reduce latency and network traffic and thus lessen the time needed to display a representation of a resource. By making use of HTTP caching, Web sites become more responsive.
  
### cookies
> An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a **small piece of data** that a **server sends to a user's web browser. **
